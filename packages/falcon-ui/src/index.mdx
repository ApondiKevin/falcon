## Introduction

**Falcon UI** is a library of composable and themable primitive UI components for React,
 that help with building consistent, fast, responsive ecommerce web apps.
 It ships as part of **@deity/falcon** starter kit, but can also be installed standalone
 using instructions below.

## Install

```sh
  yarn add @deity/falcon-ui
  # or npm i @deity/falcon-ui
```

import { Link } from 'docz';

## Usage

Wrap the root of your application with the ThemeProvider component,
which adds the theme to context that gets used by **@deity/falcon-ui** components.
ThemeProvider component accepts a `theme` props for setting a custom theme.
