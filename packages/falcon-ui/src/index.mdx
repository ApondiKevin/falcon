# Get Started

## Introduction

**Falcon UI** is a library of composable and themable primitive UI components for React,
that helps with building consistent, fast and responsive web apps.
It's shipped as a part of **@deity/falcon** starter kit, but can also be installed standalone
using instructions below.

## Install

```sh
  yarn add @deity/falcon-ui
  # or npm i @deity/falcon-ui
```

import { Link } from 'docz';

## Usage

Wrap the root of your application with the ThemeProvider component,
which adds the theme to context that gets used by **@deity/falcon-ui** components.
ThemeProvider component accepts a `theme` prop for setting a custom theme.
