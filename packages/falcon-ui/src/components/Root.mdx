# Root component
Allows applying common styles across components, like default font family.
It's rendered as a first child of ThemeProvider component so all other components
inherit styles from it by default if those are not specified somewhere else down the hierarchy.

### Basic usage
<Playground>
 <Root>
   <Box>
     hello!
  </Box>
</Root>
</Playground>
