# Babel preset Falcon Client

**You donâ€™t need to install it separately in** `@deity/falcon-client` **project.**


This preset uses the `useBuiltIns` option with [transform-object-rest-spread](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/), which assumes that `Object.assign` is available or polyfilled.
